# About Application

We have the main screen **Star Wars List** with a scrollable and paginated list of elements that navigate the user to another screen with additional information about the selected entity.

The application allow users to add list elements to favourites and calculate totals based on male/female/other gender. The user can see it on the main screen in the upper block.

The **Clear fans** button resets all the statistics to the initial state.
By clicking on any element of this list - extra information would be displayed on the **People Details** screen.

Clicking the **Add to Favorites** button will mark the selected item as liked and return you to the **Star Wars List**.
